> Project vision.

## A7: High-level architecture. Privileges. Web resources specification

> Brief presentation of the artefact's goals.

### 1. Overview

> An overview of the web application to implement is presented in this section, where the modules are identified and briefly described. The web resources associated with each module are detailed in the individual documentation of each module inside the OpenAPI specification.
